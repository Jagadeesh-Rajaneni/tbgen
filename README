                                 tbgen

tbgen is a public domain testbench generator in AWK for Verilog modules

After generating the testbench with tbgen, compile it with iverilog(1)
to generate the vvp file; then run the compiled vvp file with vvp(1) to
generate the vcd file; then run gtkwave with the generated vcd to get
the waveform.

	$ ./tbgen <module.v >testbench.v
	$ iverilog -o testbench.vvp testbench.v mymodule.v
	$ vvp testbench.vvp </dev/null
	$ gtkwave testbench.vcd

The generated testbench works by, at each simulation step, setting each
input to a random value, until the duration of the test is over.

Options:
-t TIMESCALE        Time scale in ns (default: 1).
-d DURATION         Duration of test in multiples of timescale (default: 100).
-s STEP             Duration of each step in multiples of timescale (default: 1).
-m MODULENAME       Name of the module (default based on the input).

WARNING!
Because of how AWK works, options MUST BE PRECEDED by --
For example:

	$ ./tbgen -- -d 100 -s 1 <module.v >testbench.v

WARNING!
tbgen is not a Verilog parser, it expects the module file to be well written.

TODO.
• Consider the cases when the bus sizes are parameterized.
• Improve parsing.
• Add option to generate increasing/decreasing input values.
• Add option to set input values to a constant.
